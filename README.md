# Watchy 80211 inject

This is a firmware for the [Watchy](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/) that spams wifi beacons for fun. Make sure it's legal wherever you are.

Really this is an insignificant adaptation of [esp32-80211-tx](https://github.com/Jeija/esp32-80211-tx).

What this does: your watchy is instantly cooler, and now adds Astley's masterpiece to everyone's wifi list.

## Setup

- Get [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- Set your serial port in `platformio.ini`
- Run `pio run -t upload`

## License

Upstream is MIT so I guess this is too.
